# Command-Line Notes: cut, awk, sort, uniq

## `cut` Command

### Description:
The `cut` command is used to extract specific parts of a file or input stream, typically columns from a delimited text.

### Example Usage:
```bash
cut -f 1,3 file.txt
```

### Use Case:
Extracts the first and third columns from the file.txt.


### Default Delimiter:

By default, `cut` uses a tab as the delimiter. If your file is not tab-delimited, you can specify a different delimiter using the `-d` option.

### Example with Custom Delimiter:

```bash
cut -d ',' -f 1,3 file.txt
```

### Description:
`awk` is a powerful text processing tool that allows you to perform actions on text data based on patterns.

### Example Usage:
```bash
cut -f 2 file.txt | awk '{print $1}'
```

### Use Case:
Cuts the second column from file.txt and then extracts the first field using `awk`.

## Piping with `sort`

### Description:
`sort` is used to sort lines of text files. It can be used with pipes to sort the output of other commands.

### Example Usage:
```bash
cut -f 1 file.txt | sort
```

### Use Case:
Extracts the first column from file.txt and sorts it alphabetically.

---

## Piping with `uniq`

### Description:
`uniq` is used to filter out repeated lines in a text file or input stream.

### Example Usage:
```bash
cut -f 1 file.txt | sort | uniq
```

### Use Case:
Extracts the first column from file.txt, sorts it, and then removes duplicate entries.

**Note:** Adjust the file paths and column numbers based on your specific use case. These commands are powerful tools for text manipulation and can be combined creatively to achieve various tasks in the command line.
