Certainly! Here are Obsidian notes for `grep` and `egrep`:

### `grep` (Global Regular Expression Print)

#### Overview:
- `grep` is a command-line utility in Unix/Linux used for searching and matching patterns within files.
- It is a versatile tool for text pattern matching.

#### Basic Syntax:
```bash
grep [options] pattern [file(s)]
```

#### Common Options:

1. **`-i` (Case-insensitive):**
   ```bash
   grep -i 'pattern' filename
   ```
   
2. **`-v` (Invert match):**
   ```bash
   grep -v 'pattern' filename
   ```

3. **`-n` (Display line numbers):**
   ```bash
   grep -n 'pattern' filename
   ```

4. **`-c` (Count matches):**
   ```bash
   grep -c 'pattern' filename
   ```

#### Examples:

- **Search for a pattern in a file:**
  ```bash
  grep 'pattern' filename
  ```

- **Search for a pattern in multiple files:**
  ```bash
  grep 'pattern' file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

- **Recursive search in directories:**
  ```bash
  grep -r 'pattern' directory/
  ```

### `egrep` (Extended grep)

#### Overview:
- `egrep` is an extended version of `grep` that supports extended regular expressions.

#### Basic Syntax:
```bash
egrep [options] pattern [file(s)]
```

#### Common Options:

1. **`-i` (Case-insensitive):**
   ```bash
   egrep -i 'pattern' filename
   ```

2. **`-v` (Invert match):**
   ```bash
   egrep -v 'pattern' filename
   ```

3. **`-n` (Display line numbers):**
   ```bash
   egrep -n 'pattern' filename
   ```

4. **`-c` (Count matches):**
   ```bash
   egrep -c 'pattern' filename
   ```

#### Examples:

- **Search for a pattern in a file:**
  ```bash
  egrep 'pattern' filename
  ```

- **Search for a pattern in multiple files:**
  ```bash
  egrep 'pattern' file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

- **Recursive search in directories:**
  ```bash
  egrep -r 'pattern' directory/
  ```

### Combined Example:

- **Case-insensitive search with line numbers using `grep`:**
  ```bash
  grep -in 'pattern' filename
  ```

- **Case-insensitive search with line numbers using `egrep`:**
  ```bash
  egrep -in 'pattern' filename
  ```

### `wc` (Word Count)

- `wc` is a command-line utility in Unix/Linux used to display the word count, line count, and byte count of a file.
- Basic Syntax: `wc [options] filename`
- **Options:**
  - `-l`: Display the number of lines.
  - `-w`: Display the number of words.
  - `-c`: Display the number of bytes.
### Example Usage

```bash
wc filename

```


- `wc -lwc filename` shows the line count, word count, and byte count of a file.
- Useful for quickly assessing the content size of a file or the output of other commands using pipes.
- Helpful in text processing and analysis tasks.
- Efficient for monitoring and managing file characteristics in a terminal environment.
These commands are powerful for text searching and pattern matching in files, providing flexibility and efficiency for various use cases.
