# Linux Process and Jobs Scheduling

## Processes in Linux

### Definition
- A process in Linux represents a running program, comprising executable code, data, and system resources.
- Identified by a unique Process ID (PID).
- Processes can run in the background or foreground.
- Use `ps` command to list running processes.

### Example
```bash
ps aux
```

## Jobs in Linux

### Definition
- A job is a task or set of tasks that can be executed independently in the shell.
- Managed by the shell, with the ability to run in the foreground or background.
- `jobs` command lists active jobs in the shell.

### Example
- To run a command in the background:
```bash
command &
```
- To list background jobs:
```bash
jobs
```

## Scheduling in Linux

### Cron
- Time-based job scheduler in Linux.
- Cron daemon reads the crontab to execute scheduled tasks.
- Crontab entries specify timing and command to run.

### Example
- To edit the crontab:
```bash
crontab -e
```
- Add the following entry to run a script every day at 2 AM:
```bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh
```

### At
- `at` command schedules a job to run at a specific time once.
- Jobs scheduled with `at` run only once at the specified time.

### Example
- To schedule a job using `at`:
```bash
at 10:30 PM
```
- Enter the command and press `Ctrl + D` to submit.

# Daemon vs Process, Script, and Jobs in Linux

## Daemon

### Definition
- A daemon is a background process that runs continuously, often initiated at system startup.
- Daemons provide services or perform tasks without direct user interaction.
- Examples include web servers (like Apache), email servers (like Postfix), and system services.

## Process

### Definition
- A process in Linux represents a running program, consisting of executable code, data, and system resources.
- Processes can run in the background or foreground, and each is identified by a unique Process ID (PID).
- Managed by the kernel and can be monitored using commands like `ps` and `top`.

## Script

### Definition
- A script is a sequence of commands or instructions written in a scripting language (e.g., Bash, Python).
- Executed by an interpreter, and they are typically used for automation, repetitive tasks, or to execute a series of commands.
- Can be run interactively or saved in a file and executed as a script.

### Example
- Bash Script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## Jobs

### Definition
- A job is a task or set of tasks that can be executed independently in the shell.
- Managed by the shell, jobs can run in the foreground or background.
- Jobs can be scheduled using utilities like `cron` and `at`.

### Example
- To run a command in the background:
```bash
command &
```
- To list background jobs:
```bash
jobs
```
