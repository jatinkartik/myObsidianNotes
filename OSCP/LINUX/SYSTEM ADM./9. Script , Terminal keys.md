### `script` Command

#### **`script` Command:**
```bash
script
```
- **Description:**
  - The `script` command is used to record a terminal session.

- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  script [options] [file]
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```bash
  script session.log
  ```
  This starts recording the session and saves it to a file named `session.log`.
