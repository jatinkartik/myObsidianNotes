To create a Logical Volume (LV) for a disk and then add another disk to it later, you'd typically follow these steps:

### Creating a Logical Volume (LV) for a Disk:

**Definition:** Logical Volume Management (LVM) is a method of allocating space on storage devices that allows for flexibility and ease of management.

**Example Use Case:** Suppose you have a Linux server with a new disk (/dev/sdb) that you want to add as an LVM.

1. **Partition the Disk:**
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
   ```

2. **Create a Physical Volume (PV):**
   ```bash
   sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1
   ```

3. **Create a Volume Group (VG):**
   ```bash
   sudo vgcreate myvg /dev/sdb1
   ```

4. **Create a Logical Volume (LV):**
   ```bash
   sudo lvcreate -n mylv -l 100%FREE myvg
   ```

### Adding a Disk to an Existing Logical Volume (LV):

**Use Case:** Now, let's say you want to add another disk (/dev/sdc) to the existing LV (`mylv`).

1. **Partition the New Disk:**
   ```bash
   sudo fdisk /dev/sdc
   ```

2. **Create a Physical Volume (PV) on the New Disk:**
   ```bash
   sudo pvcreate /dev/sdc1
   ```

3. **Extend the Volume Group (VG) to Include the New PV:**
   ```bash
   sudo vgextend myvg /dev/sdc1
   ```

4. **Extend the Logical Volume (LV) to Include the New PV:**
   ```bash
   sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/myvg/mylv
   ```

- Note if device is already mounted it may be show as /dev/mapper/myvg-mylv instead of **/dev/myvg/mylv** use that if it show in **df -h** command. 

5. **Resize the File System:**
   ```bash
   sudo resize2fs /dev/myvg/mylv
   ```
 
 -  Note Above command resize above lvm storage.
 - Note if device is already mounted it may be show as /dev/mapper/myvg-mylv instead of **/dev/myvg/mylv** use that if it show in **df -h** command. 

6.  **Grow File System to Take Effect**

```Shell
sudo xfs_growfs /mnt/mountpoint
```

- Note in above command mount point is used instead of device name like in our case its mounted at location **/mnt/usb**

This process will extend the existing Logical Volume (`mylv`) to include the space from the new disk (/dev/sdc), thus effectively adding the new disk to the logical volume.
