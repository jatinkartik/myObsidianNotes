### fsck

#### Definition
`fsck` (File System Consistency Check) is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used to check and repair inconsistencies in filesystems.
- Run at boottime and mainly used in single user mode to repair file system on root patition.

#### Example Uses
- Checking a filesystem for errors: `fsck /dev/sda1`
- Automatically repairing filesystem errors: `fsck -a /dev/sda1`

#### Options
- `-a` or `--auto`: Automatically repair the filesystem without any prompts.
- `-r` or `--interactive`: Interactive repair, prompting for confirmation before making repairs.
- `-n` or `--no`: Do not execute any repairs, just report the errors.
- `-y`: Assume "yes" to all questions, repairing the filesystem without user intervention.
- `-t`: Specify the type of filesystem to be checked (e.g., ext2, ext3, ext4).

#### Exit Codes
- `0`: No errors
- `1`: Filesystem errors corrected
- `2`: System should be rebooted
- `4`: Filesystem errors left uncorrected
- `8`: Operational error
- `16`: Usage or syntax error
- `32`: Fsck canceled by user request
- `128`: Shared library error

### xfs_repair

#### Definition
`xfs_repair` is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems used to check and repair XFS filesystems.
-  Can we used only on xfs file system and mainly used for larged data partition.
- Not Run on boot, that mean it only used manually.
#### Example Uses
- Checking and repairing an XFS filesystem: `xfs_repair /dev/sda1`

#### Options
- `-n`: No modify mode, checks the filesystem without making any repairs.
- `-L`: Force log zeroing, discarding the log file to allow the filesystem to be mounted.
- `-P`: Disable prefetching to reduce memory usage.
- `-v`: Verbose mode, providing more detailed output.

#### Exit Codes
- `0`: No errors
- `1`: Errors detected and corrected
- `2`: Errors detected that could not be corrected
- `3`: Operational error

### Use Cases
- **fsck**: Used regularly to maintain filesystem health, especially after improper shutdowns or power failures.
- **xfs_repair**: Essential for administrators managing XFS filesystems, particularly in scenarios involving unexpected crashes or hardware failures.
