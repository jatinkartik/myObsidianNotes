## NFS Configuration Guide

### Introduction
Network File System (NFS) allows for file sharing over a network. This guide covers the configuration of an NFS server to share a filesystem over the internet, including steps for setting up both a single user and open access for everyone.

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the following packages installed:
  - `nfs-utils`
  - `libnfsidmap`
  - `rpcbind`

### Server Configuration

#### Install Required Packages
```sh
sudo dnf install nfs-utils libnfsidmap rpcbind -y  # For RHEL-based systems
sudo apt-get install nfs-common nfs-kernel-server rpcbind -y  # For Debian-based systems
```

#### Start and Enable Services
Before configuring NFS, start and enable the necessary services:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now rpcbind
sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-server
sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-lock  or rpc-statd # use only one
sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-idmap
```

#### Create the Shared Directory
Create a directory you want to share over NFS:
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /srv/nfs/shared
sudo chown nobody:nogroup /srv/nfs/shared  # Adjust ownership as needed
or sudo chown a+rwx /srv/nfs/shared
```

#### Configure Exports
Edit the `/etc/exports` file to define the NFS share:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/exports
```
Add the following lines:

**For a specific user (IP address 192.168.1.10):**
```sh
/srv/nfs/shared 192.168.1.10(rw,sync,no_subtree_check, no_root_squash)
```

- *Note* -  the following options may have security effect should be used with proper  knowledge otherwise remove them.
- 
- **no_root_squash**:
    
    - Disables the default root squashing behavior.
    - Allows root users on NFS clients to have root privileges on the NFS server.
    - Used when administrative tasks require root access.
    - Example: `no_root_squash` is useful when NFS clients need to perform tasks that require root access, such as managing system files or installing software.
    
- **no_subtree_check**:
    
    - Disables the default subtree checking behavior.
    - Improves performance by skipping the verification check.
    - Useful for large exported directories or frequent access requests.
    - Example: `no_subtree_check` is beneficial in environments where performance is a concern and the exported directory structure is stable, reducing the need for the subtree check.

**For everyone (open access):**
```sh
/srv/nfs/shared *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

#### Apply Export Changes
Apply the changes made in the `/etc/exports` file:
```sh
sudo exportfs -rva
```

#### Configure Firewall
Open the necessary ports in the firewall for NFS:
```sh
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mountd
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Client Configuration

#### Install Required Packages
```sh
sudo dnf install nfs-utils -y  # For RHEL-based systems
sudo apt-get install nfs-common -y  # For Debian-based systems
```

#### Start and Enable Services
Ensure that the necessary services are started and enabled on the client:
```sh
sudo systemctl enable --now rpcbind
sudo systemctl enable --now nfs-lock  # or rpc-statd
```

#### Discover NFS Shares
List available NFS shares from the server (replace `nfs-server-ip` with the server's IP address):
```sh
showmount -e nfs-server-ip
```

#### Mount NFS Share

**Temporary Mount:**
Create a mount point and mount the NFS share:
```sh
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/shared
sudo mount nfs-server-ip:/srv/nfs/shared /mnt/nfs/shared
```

**Permanent Mount:**
To mount the NFS share automatically at boot, add an entry to `/etc/fstab`:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
Add the following line:
```sh
nfs-server-ip:/srv/nfs/shared /mnt/nfs/shared nfs defaults 0 0
```

### Verifying the Setup
1. **Check NFS Exports on Server:**
   ```sh
   sudo exportfs -v
   ```

2. **Check Mounted NFS Shares on Client:**
   ```sh
   df -h | grep nfs
   ```

### Troubleshooting
- **Check Service Status:**
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl status nfs-server
  sudo systemctl status rpcbind
  sudo systemctl status nfs-lock  # or rpc-statd
  ```

- **Check Logs for Errors:**
  ```sh
  sudo journalctl -xe
  ```

- **Firewall Issues:**
  Ensure that the necessary ports are open and accessible.
