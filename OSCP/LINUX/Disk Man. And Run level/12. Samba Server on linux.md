# Samba Download, Install, and Configuration
	
## Overview
- **Samba**: A Linux tool/utility that allows sharing resources such as files and printers with other operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS).
- **Comparison with NFS**: NFS shares within Linux/Unix systems, whereas Samba shares with other OS.
- **Example**: If computer "A" shares its filesystem with computer "B" using Samba, computer "B" will see it as if it is mounted as the local filesystem.
- **Protocols**: Samba uses SMB (Server Message Block) and CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocols.

## Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

### Preparation
- Take a snapshot of your VM.

### Install Samba Packages
```bash
# Become root user
sudo su

# Install Samba packages
yum install samba samba-client samba-common
```

### Enable Samba through Firewall (if running)
```bash
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=samba
firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Stop and Disable Firewall or iptables
```bash
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl stop iptables
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl disable iptables
```

### Create Samba Share Directory and Assign Permissions
```bash
mkdir -p /samba/morepretzels
chmod a+rwx /samba/morepretzels
chown -R nobody:nobody /samba
```

### Change SELinux Security Context (if SELinux enabled)
```bash
chcon -t samba_share_t /samba/morepretzels
```

### Disable SELinux (optional)
```bash
sestatus # To check SELinux status

# Edit SELinux config
vi /etc/selinux/config

# Change SELINUX=enforcing to SELINUX=disabled
# Reboot the system
reboot
```

### Modify smb.conf File
- **Backup the smb.conf file** before making changes.
```bash
# Edit smb.conf file
vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

# Add the following parameters
[global]
  workgroup = WORKGROUP
  netbios name = centos
  security = user
  map to guest = bad user
  dns proxy = no

[Anonymous]
  path = /samba/morepretzels
  browsable = yes
  writable = yes
  guest ok = yes
  guest only = yes
  read only = no
```

# Explanation of Options in smb.conf File

## Global Section
### `[global]`
- **workgroup = WORKGROUP**: Specifies the workgroup name, which should match the workgroup name used by Windows clients.
- **netbios name = centos**: Sets the NetBIOS name of the Samba server; this is how the server will appear to Windows clients.
- **security = user**: Specifies that Samba will use user-level security, meaning clients must provide a valid username and password.
- **map to guest = bad user**: Maps users who fail authentication to the guest account.
- **dns proxy = no**: Disables DNS proxy, meaning Samba will not use DNS to resolve NetBIOS names.

## Share Definitions
### `[Anonymous]`
- **path = /samba/morepretzels**: Specifies the directory path that is shared.
- **browsable = yes**: Allows the shared directory to be visible in the network neighborhood.
- **writable = yes**: Allows users to write to the shared directory.
- **guest ok = yes**: Permits guest access to the shared directory without a password.
- **guest only = yes**: Restricts access to guest users only.
- **read only = no**: Ensures the share is writable; equivalent to `writable = yes`.

### `[Secure]`
- **path = /samba/securepretzels**: Specifies the directory path for the secure share.
- **valid users = @smbgrp**: Restricts access to users who are members of the `smbgrp` group.
- **guest ok = no**: Disallows guest access to the share.
- **writable = yes**: Allows users to write to the shared directory.
- **browsable = yes**: Allows the shared directory to be visible in the network neighborhood.

## Example smb.conf File
```ini
[global]
  workgroup = WORKGROUP
  netbios name = centos
  security = user
  map to guest = bad user
  dns proxy = no

[Anonymous]
  path = /samba/morepretzels
  browsable = yes
  writable = yes
  guest ok = yes
  guest only = yes
  read only = no

[Secure]
  path = /samba/securepretzels
  valid users = @smbgrp
  guest ok = no
  writable = yes
  browsable = yes
```

These options configure the Samba server to share directories with specified permissions and access controls, allowing both anonymous and authenticated access depending on the share.
### Verify the Settings
```bash
testparm
```

### Enable and Start Samba Services
```bash
systemctl enable smb
systemctl enable nmb
systemctl start smb
systemctl start nmb
```

## Mount Samba Share

### On Windows Client
1. Go to Start.
2. Use the search bar to type `\\192.168.1.95` (replace with your server IP).

### On Linux Client
```bash
# Become root user
sudo su

# Install necessary packages
yum -y install cifs-utils samba-client

# Create a mount point directory
mkdir /mnt/sambashare

# Mount the samba share
mount -t cifs //192.168.1.95/Anonymous /mnt/sambashare/
```

## Secure Samba Server

### Create Group and User
```bash
# Create a user and group
useradd larry
groupadd smbgrp
usermod -a -G smbgrp larry

# Set Samba password for user
smbpasswd -a larry
New SMB password: YOUR SAMBA PASS
Retype new SMB password: REPEAT YOUR SAMBA PASS
```

### Create a New Secure Share
```bash
# Create directory and set permissions
mkdir /samba/securepretzels
chown -R larry:smbgrp /samba/securepretzels
chmod -R 0770 /samba/securepretzels
chcon -t samba_share_t /samba/securepretzels
```

### Edit smb.conf File
- **Backup the smb.conf file** before making changes.
```bash
# Edit smb.conf file
vi /etc/samba/smb.conf

# Add the following lines
[Secure]
  path = /samba/securepretzels
  valid users = @smbgrp
  guest ok = no
  writable = yes
  browsable = yes
```

### Restart Samba Services
```bash
systemctl restart smb
systemctl restart nmb
```
