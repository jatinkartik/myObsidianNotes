### Computer Boot Process

**Definition:**
The computer boot process is the sequence of events that occur when a computer is powered on, leading to the loading of the operating system.

#### Stages of the Boot Process:

1. **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)**
   - **Definition:** The firmware interface that initializes hardware during the booting process.
   - **Use Case:** Performs the POST (Power-On Self Test) to check hardware functionality and locates the boot device.

2. **CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor)**
   - **Definition:** A small amount of memory powered by a battery that stores BIOS settings.
   - **Use Case:** Keeps system time and configuration settings even when the computer is powered off.

3. **Boot Device Selection**
   - **Definition:** BIOS checks for the boot sequence to find a device with a bootable operating system.
   - **Use Case:** Determines which device to boot from, such as HDD, SSD, CD/DVD, or USB.

4. **MBR (Master Boot Record)**
   - **Definition:** The first sector of a storage device that contains the bootloader.
   - **Use Case:** Loads the bootloader from the boot device into memory.

5. **Bootloader Execution**
   - **Definition:** A small program that loads the operating system kernel.
   - **Use Case:** Transfers control to the OS kernel to continue the boot process.

### Linux Boot Process

**Definition:**
The sequence of events that occur from the bootloader loading the kernel to the Linux operating system becoming fully operational.

#### Stages of the Linux Boot Process:

1. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization**
   - **Definition:** The initial stage where BIOS/UEFI firmware initializes hardware and selects the boot device.
   - **Use Case:** Prepares the system to load the bootloader.

2. **Bootloader (GRUB, LILO, etc.)**
   - **Definition:** The program responsible for loading the Linux kernel.
   - **Use Case:** Provides a menu to select the operating system or kernel parameters and loads the selected kernel into memory.

3. **Kernel Initialization**
   - **Definition:** The Linux kernel is loaded into memory and begins to execute.
   - **Use Case:** Sets up essential hardware, mounts the root filesystem, and starts the initial process (init/systemd).

4. **Initial RAM Disk (initrd/initramfs)**
   - **Definition:** A temporary filesystem used to load necessary drivers and modules before the actual root filesystem is mounted.
   - **Use Case:** Provides a minimal environment to support the kernel until the root filesystem is accessible.

5. **init/Systemd Process**
   - **Definition:** The first user-space process started by the Linux kernel (PID 1).
   - **Use Case:** Initializes the user environment, starts system services, and brings the system to the desired state.

6. **Runlevel/Target**
   - **Definition:** The state defined by the services and processes that should be running (e.g., multi-user mode, graphical mode).
   - **Use Case:** Ensures that all necessary services are started and the system is fully operational.
