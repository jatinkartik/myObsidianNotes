## Stratis Storage Management on Red Hat

### Introduction
Stratis is a local storage management solution for Linux, providing advanced features such as thin provisioning, snapshots, and easy pool and filesystem management. It simplifies the management of storage through a unified interface.

### Prerequisites
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 or later
- `stratis-cli` and `stratisd` packages installed

### Installation
```sh
sudo dnf install stratis-cli stratisd
sudo systemctl enable --now stratisd
```

### Basic Stratis Commands

#### Create a Stratis Pool
A Stratis pool is a collection of one or more block devices.
```sh
sudo stratis pool create mypool /dev/sdX
```
Replace `/dev/sdX` with your actual device identifier.

#### List Stratis Pools
To list all the Stratis pools on the system:
```sh
sudo stratis pool list
```

### Manage Filesystems

#### Create a Stratis Filesystem
After creating a pool, you can create filesystems within it.
```sh
sudo stratis filesystem create mypool myfs
```

#### List Stratis Filesystems
To list all filesystems within a Stratis pool:
```sh
sudo stratis filesystem list mypool
```

### Mounting a Stratis Filesystem
To use the filesystem, you need to mount it to a directory.

1. **Create a mount point:**
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /mnt/myfs
   ```

2. **Mount the filesystem:**
   ```sh
   sudo mount /stratis/mypool/myfs /mnt/myfs
   ```

3. **Verify the mount:**
   ```sh
   df -h | grep myfs
   ```

### Unmounting a Stratis Filesystem
To unmount the filesystem when it's no longer needed:
```sh
sudo umount /mnt/myfs
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Adding a Device to a Pool
To expand the pool by adding another device:
```sh
sudo stratis pool add-data mypool /dev/sdY
```
Replace `/dev/sdY` with your new device identifier.

#### Removing a Device from a Pool
To remove a device from a pool (ensure the data is migrated):
```sh
sudo stratis pool remove-data mypool /dev/sdZ
```
Replace `/dev/sdZ` with the device to be removed.

#### Deleting a Filesystem
To delete a Stratis filesystem:
```sh
sudo stratis filesystem destroy mypool myfs
```

#### Destroying a Stratis Pool
To completely destroy a Stratis pool:
```sh
sudo stratis pool destroy mypool
```

### Monitoring Stratis

#### Pool Status
To check the status and properties of a pool:
```sh
sudo stratis pool list
```

#### Filesystem Usage
To check the usage statistics of a filesystem:
```sh
sudo stratis filesystem list mypool
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Checking Logs
If you encounter issues, check the logs for `stratisd` service:
```sh
sudo journalctl -u stratisd
```
