# System Tuning by `tuned`

## Overview
`tuned` is a daemon for optimizing system performance by dynamically tuning system settings based on the type of workload. It uses profiles to adjust various system parameters such as CPU, disk, and network settings.

## Commands and Options

### `tuned-adm`
- **Definition**: The main command to manage `tuned` profiles.
- **Use Case**: Apply, list, and manage tuning profiles.

### `tuned-adm list`
- **Definition**: Lists all available tuning profiles.
- **Use Case**: View available profiles to select an appropriate one for your workload.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  tuned-adm list
  ```

### `tuned-adm active`
- **Definition**: Displays the currently active tuning profile.
- **Use Case**: Check which profile is currently applied to the system.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  tuned-adm active
  ```

### `tuned-adm profile <profile_name>`
- **Definition**: Activates the specified tuning profile.
- **Use Case**: Apply a specific tuning profile to optimize system performance for a particular workload.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  tuned-adm profile throughput-performance
  ```

### `tuned-adm recommend`
- **Definition**: Recommends the most suitable tuning profile based on the system's hardware.
- **Use Case**: Get a recommendation for the best profile for your system.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  tuned-adm recommend
  ```

### `tuned-adm off`
- **Definition**: Deactivates all tuning profiles.
- **Use Case**: Revert to default system settings without any active tuning.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  tuned-adm off
  ```

## Use Cases

1. **Improve Server Performance**:
   - Apply the `throughput-performance` profile to optimize for high throughput.
     ```bash
     tuned-adm profile throughput-performance
     ```

2. **Optimize for Low Latency**:
   - Use the `latency-performance` profile to reduce system latency.
     ```bash
     tuned-adm profile latency-performance
     ```

3. **Balance Between Performance and Power Saving**:
   - Apply the `balanced` profile to achieve a balance between performance and energy efficiency.
     ```bash
     tuned-adm profile balanced
     ```

4. **Energy Savings**:
   - Use the `powersave` profile to minimize power consumption.
     ```bash
     tuned-adm profile powersave
     ```

5. **Check Active Profile**:
   - Verify which tuning profile is currently active on the system.
     ```bash
     tuned-adm active
     ```

6. **List Available Profiles**:
   - View all available profiles to decide which one to apply.
     ```bash
     tuned-adm list
     ```

## Example Profiles

### `throughput-performance`
- **Description**: Optimizes for maximum throughput by setting CPU governor to performance and adjusting other system parameters for high data transfer rates.

### `latency-performance`
- **Description**: Reduces latency by prioritizing low-latency settings in CPU, network, and disk configurations.

### `balanced`
- **Description**: Provides a balance between performance and power saving by dynamically adjusting system settings based on current workload.

### `powersave`
- **Description**: Minimizes power consumption by using power-saving settings for CPU and other system components.



# Process Tuning  by`nice` and `renice`

## Overview
`nice` and `renice` are commands used to set or modify the priority of processes in Unix-like operating systems. The priority level affects the scheduling of processes by the kernel.

## Priority Levels

### Understanding Priority Levels

- **Highest Priority**: -20
- **Lowest Priority**: 19
- **Default Priority**: 0

### Priority Level Mapping

- **-20**: Highest priority (most favorable scheduling)
- ...
- **0**: Default priority for regular user processes
- ...
- **19**: Lowest priority (least favorable scheduling)

### System Priority Level (PR)

- **PR**: Stands for "priority" and is a value derived from the `nice` value of a process. The system priority level is used by the kernel scheduler to determine the order in which processes are executed.
- The system priority level is a combination of the `nice` value and other factors determined by the kernel, such as the current system load and the process's past CPU usage.

## Commands and Options

### `nice`

- **Definition**: Starts a process with a specified priority.
- **Use Case**: Launch a new process with a non-default priority.

#### Syntax
```bash
nice -n <priority> <command>
```

#### Example
```bash
nice -n 10 ./myprogram
```

### `renice`

- **Definition**: Changes the priority of an already running process.
- **Use Case**: Adjust the priority of an existing process to improve system performance.

#### Syntax
```bash
renice <priority> -p <pid>
```

#### Example
```bash
renice -5 -p 1234
```

### Listing Process Priorities

- **Command**: Lists the PID, command, nice value, and scheduling class of processes, sorted by nice value.
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  ps xo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice
  ```
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  ps xo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice
  ```

## Detailed Example

### Step-by-Step

1. **Start a Process with Specific Priority**:
   - Launch `myprogram` with a nice value of 10 (lower priority).
   ```bash
   nice -n 10 ./myprogram
   ```

2. **Change Priority of Running Process**:
   - Change the priority of process with PID 1234 to -5 (higher priority).
   ```bash
   renice -5 -p 1234
   ```

3. **List Processes by Priority**:
   - Display processes sorted by their nice values in descending order (highest priority first).
   ```bash
   ps xo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice
   ```

   **Output**:
   ```
     PID COMMAND        NI CLS
    1234 myprogram     -5  TS
    5678 anotherprog    0  TS
    9101 lowpriority   10  TS
   ```

### Use Cases

1. **Improve Performance of Critical Processes**:
   - Increase the priority of a database server to ensure it gets more CPU time.
   ```bash
   renice -10 -p $(pidof mysqld)
   ```

2. **Reduce Impact of Background Tasks**:
   - Start a backup script with lower priority to avoid impacting the performance of interactive applications.
   ```bash
   nice -n 15 /path/to/backup_script.sh
   ```

3. **Monitor and Adjust Priorities Dynamically**:
   - Regularly check and adjust process priorities based on current system load and requirements.
   ```bash
   ps xo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice
   renice -n 5 -p <pid_of_high_load_process>
   ```

By effectively using `nice` and `renice`, system administrators can manage process priorities to ensure that critical tasks receive adequate CPU resources while less important processes do not interfere with the system's overall performance.
