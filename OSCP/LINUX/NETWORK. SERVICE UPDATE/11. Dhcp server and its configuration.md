# DHCP Server Configuration in Obsidian

## Definition and Example Uses

### DHCP Server
A **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) Server** is a network server that automatically provides and assigns IP addresses, default gateways, and other network parameters to client devices. It uses the DHCP protocol to respond to broadcast queries by clients.

#### Example Uses
- Automatically assigning IP addresses in a network.
- Providing essential network information to devices such as DNS servers and default gateway.

### Configuration File: /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
The **dhcpd.conf** file is the configuration file for the DHCP server daemon, which contains settings and options for the DHCP server.

#### Example Configuration
```plaintext
# DHCP Server Configuration file.
#   see /usr/share/doc/dhcp-server/dhcpd.conf.example
#   see dhcpd.conf(5) man page

default-lease-time 600;
max-lease-time 7200;

ddns-update-style none;
authoritative;

subnet 192.168.215.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.215.10 192.168.215.200;
  option routers 192.168.215.1;
  option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
  option domain-name-servers 8.8.4.4, 8.8.8.8;
}
```

## Detailed Explanation of DHCP Server Configuration Options

### Global Configuration Options

1. **default-lease-time 600;**
   - **Definition**: Sets the default time (in seconds) for which a client can use an IP address before it must request a renewal.
   - **Purpose**: Provides a default lease period to ensure that IP addresses are periodically released and reassigned.
   - **Usage**: Typically set to a value that balances frequent renewals and IP address utilization efficiency.

2. **max-lease-time 7200;**
   - **Definition**: Specifies the maximum time (in seconds) a client can use an IP address before it must request a renewal.
   - **Purpose**: Limits the maximum lease duration to ensure IP address availability.
   - **Usage**: Should be set based on network needs; longer lease times reduce renewal traffic but may cause IP address exhaustion.

3. **ddns-update-style none;**
   - **Definition**: Disables Dynamic DNS updates.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that the DHCP server does not attempt to update DNS records.
   - **Usage**: Set to `none` if not integrating DHCP with DNS updates. Options include `none`, `interim`, or `ad-hoc`.

4. **authoritative;**
   - **Definition**: Indicates that this DHCP server is authoritative for the local network.
   - **Purpose**: Informs clients that this server's responses are definitive, preventing clients from trying other servers unnecessarily.
   - **Usage**: Essential in environments with multiple DHCP servers to avoid conflicts and ensure proper IP assignment.

### Subnet Declaration

5. **subnet 192.168.215.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { ... }**
   - **Definition**: Declares a subnet along with its netmask. All IP range and option settings within the braces apply to this subnet.
   - **Purpose**: Defines the scope of IP addresses and network configuration for a specific subnet.
   - **Usage**: Adjust the subnet address and netmask according to the specific network segment.

### Subnet-Specific Options

6. **range 192.168.215.10 192.168.215.200;**
   - **Definition**: Specifies the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign to clients within the subnet.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures controlled and sequential distribution of IP addresses.
   - **Usage**: Adjust to fit the number of devices expected on the network while avoiding static IP ranges.

7. **option routers 192.168.215.1;**
   - **Definition**: Sets the default gateway for the subnet.
   - **Purpose**: Informs clients which router to use for internet or inter-network traffic.
   - **Usage**: Set to the IP address of the network's router or gateway.

8. **option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;**
   - **Definition**: Specifies the subnet mask for the clients.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that clients know the correct subnet mask to use for network communication.
   - **Usage**: Matches the subnet mask defined in the subnet declaration.

9. **option domain-name-servers 8.8.4.4, 8.8.8.8;**
   - **Definition**: Provides a list of DNS servers for the clients.
   - **Purpose**: Allows clients to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
   - **Usage**: Set to preferred DNS servers, which can be public DNS servers like Google's (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) or local DNS servers.

### Additional Options (Not in Provided Configuration)

10. **option domain-name "example.com";**
    - **Definition**: Specifies the domain name that clients should use.
    - **Purpose**: Helps clients resolve local network names more easily.
    - **Usage**: Set to the network's domain name.

11. **host specific-client { ... }**
    - **Definition**: Declares settings for a specific client identified by its MAC address.
    - **Purpose**: Allows for static IP address assignment and custom options for specific devices.
    - **Usage**: Useful for servers or devices needing a fixed IP.

### Commands for Starting Service and Configuring Firewall

#### Starting the DHCP Service
To start the DHCP service, use the following commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl start dhcpd
sudo systemctl enable dhcpd
```

#### Adding DHCP Service to Firewalld
To allow DHCP through the firewall, execute:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=dhcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## Use Cases
1. **Setting Default and Max Lease Times**:
   - `default-lease-time 600;` specifies that the default lease time for IP addresses is 600 seconds.
   - `max-lease-time 7200;` sets the maximum lease time to 7200 seconds.
   
2. **Defining a Subnet**:
   - The subnet declaration `subnet 192.168.215.0 netmask 255.255.255.0` defines a range of IP addresses within this subnet.
   - `range 192.168.215.10 192.168.215.200;` specifies the pool of IP addresses that can be assigned to clients.
   - `option routers 192.168.215.1;` sets the default gateway for clients.
   - `option domain-name-servers 8.8.4.4, 8.8.8.8;` provides DNS servers for the clients.

## Summary
This guide covers the basic configuration of a DHCP server using the **/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf** file and includes commands to start the DHCP service and configure the firewall to allow DHCP traffic. This setup ensures that clients on the network receive IP addresses and necessary network configuration automatically. This detailed guide explains each option in the **/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf** file, its purpose, and typical usage scenarios. The configuration enables efficient and effective management of IP address allocation and network settings, ensuring smooth operation of networked devices.
