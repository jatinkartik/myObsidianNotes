### YUM Command in Obsidian Notes

#### Definition
**YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)** is a package management tool for RPM-based distributions. It simplifies the process of managing packages, including installation, updating, and removal of software.

### YUM Update vs Upgrade

- **`yum update`**
  - **Definition**: Updates all packages to the latest version available in the repository, but does not remove any obsolete packages.
  - **Use Case**: When you want to ensure all installed packages are up-to-date.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    yum update
    ```

- **`yum upgrade`**
  - **Definition**: Similar to `yum update`, but it also handles obsolete packages by removing them if necessary.
  - **Use Case**: When you want to ensure all installed packages are up-to-date and obsolete packages are removed.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    yum upgrade
    ```

### YUM History

- **`yum history`**
  - **Definition**: Displays the transaction history of YUM, including installations, updates, and removals.
  - **Use Case**: When you want to review past package management actions.
  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    yum history
    ```
  - **Output**:
    ```

    ```

- **`yum history undo <id>`**
  - **Definition**: Reverts the changes made by a specific transaction ID in the YUM history.
  - **Use Case**: When you need to undo a specific installation, update, or removal action.

    ```bash
    yum history undo 18
    ```

    ```

### Why Rolling Back to a Minor Version is Not Recommended

- **Reason**: Rolling back to a previous minor version can lead to inconsistencies and dependency issues.
  - **Details**: When you downgrade packages to a previous minor version, there might be newer dependencies and configuration changes that are incompatible with the older versions. This can result in broken dependencies, security vulnerabilities, and unstable system behavior.
  - **Example**: If a security patch was applied in a newer minor version, rolling back would remove this patch and expose the system to known vulnerabilities.

### Use Cases

1. **Regular System Maintenance**: Use `yum update` to keep all packages up-to-date and secure.
2. **Major System Upgrades**: Use `yum upgrade` when performing significant system updates, ensuring obsolete packages are cleaned up.
3. **Audit and Troubleshoot**: Use `yum history` to review past actions and troubleshoot issues.
4. **Revert Unwanted Changes**: Use `yum history undo <id>` to revert specific actions, such as uninstalling a necessary package or installing an unwanted one.

These commands and practices help maintain the system's stability, security, and consistency.
