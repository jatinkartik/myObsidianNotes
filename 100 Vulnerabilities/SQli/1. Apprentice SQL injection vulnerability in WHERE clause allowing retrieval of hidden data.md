# LAB - Apprentice: SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

- **Type:** Lab
- **Level:** Apprentice

## Description
This lab involves exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability in the WHERE clause to retrieve hidden data. The application is susceptible to unauthorized access through crafted SQL queries, which can manipulate the WHERE clause to reveal hidden information.

## Exploiting Method
1. Identify the vulnerable input: Look for user inputs, such as search boxes or login credentials, where user-supplied data is processed in the WHERE clause of an SQL query.

2. Craft a malicious input: Inject SQL code into the input to manipulate the query's logic. For example:
   ```sql
   ' OR '1'='1'; --
   ```

3. Observe the results: If successful, the application might reveal hidden data that was not intended to be accessible.

## Patching
To secure the application against this type of SQL injection, implement parameterized queries or prepared statements. Parameterized queries ensure that user inputs are treated as data rather than executable code, preventing SQL injection attacks. Additionally, input validation and proper error handling should be enforced to detect and mitigate potential security threats.

## Example Query 

```example 
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' OR '1'='1'; --
```
