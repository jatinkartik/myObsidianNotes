# LAB - Apprentice: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

- **Type:** Lab
- **Level:** Apprentice

## Description
This lab demonstrates a SQL injection vulnerability that allows for login bypass. The application's login mechanism is insecure and can be exploited to gain unauthorized access by manipulating the SQL query used for authentication.

## Exploiting Method
1. Identify the login form: Locate the input fields where the application processes login credentials.

2. Craft a malicious input: Inject SQL code into the login credentials to manipulate the authentication query. For example:
   ```sql
   ' OR '1'='1'; --
   ```

3. Submit the login form: If successful, the application may grant access without valid credentials, effectively bypassing the login mechanism.

## Patching
To secure the application against this type of SQL injection, implement parameterized queries or prepared statements in the authentication process. Validate and sanitize user inputs to ensure they do not manipulate the SQL query. Additionally, consider implementing strong password policies and multi-factor authentication to enhance overall security.
