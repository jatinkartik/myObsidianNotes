### MAC Addresses and Related Concepts

#### Definition and Use Cases

---

**MAC Address**

- **Definition**: A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) for communications at the data link layer of the OSI model.
- **Use Case**: Identifying devices on a local network.

**Structure of MAC Address**

- **Format**: 48-bit address typically represented as 12 hexadecimal digits.
- **Example**: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`

**Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)**

- **Definition**: The first 24 bits (or first 6 hexadecimal digits) of a MAC address, assigned by IEEE to identify the manufacturer.
- **Use Case**: Identifying the vendor or manufacturer of a device.

**Hexadecimal Value Range**

- **Range**: 00 to 31 (in hexadecimal)
  - **Examples**:
    - 00: `00`
    - 01: `01`
    - 02: `02`
    - ...
    - 31: `1F`

**MAC Address Types**

1. **Known Unicast**
   - **Definition**: A MAC address that is recognized by the switch's MAC address table.
   - **Use Case**: Directs traffic to a specific device.
   - **Command Example**:
     ```bash
     show mac address-table
     ```

2. **Unknown Unicast / Flooding**
   - **Definition**: When the destination MAC address is not in the switch's MAC address table, the frame is flooded to all ports except the incoming port.
   - **Use Case**: Ensures delivery of frames to devices whose MAC addresses are not known by the switch.

3. **Allcast**
   - **Definition**: Generally used to describe the transmission of data to all nodes in a network segment, often confused with broadcast.
   - **Use Case**: Not typically used in standard Ethernet terminology.

**OSI Model and MAC Address Tracking**

**OSI Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)**
- **Role**: Uses MAC addresses to deliver frames within the same local network.
- **Data Unit**: Frame
- **Components**:
  - Destination MAC Address
  - Source MAC Address
  - Type/Length
  - Packet (contains the higher layer data)

**Process to Populate MAC Address Table**
1. **Frame Reception**
   - Switch receives a frame on one of its ports.
   
2. **Source MAC Learning**
   - The switch reads the source MAC address and records it in its MAC address table along with the incoming port.

3. **Destination MAC Lookup**
   - The switch checks its MAC address table for the destination MAC address.

4. **Frame Forwarding**
   - If the destination MAC is found (known unicast), the frame is forwarded to the corresponding port.
   - If not found (unknown unicast), the frame is flooded to all ports except the one it came from.

**Commands for MAC Address Table Management**

1. **Show MAC Address Table**
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     show mac address-table
     ```

2. **Clear MAC Address Table**
   - **Command**:
     ```bash
     clear mac address-table
     ```
