### Switch Interface Configuration

**Definition:**  
A switch interface configuration involves setting the operational parameters of a network switch port. This includes its administrative state (up or down), duplex mode (full or half), and speed settings (fixed or auto-negotiated).

**Examples of Configuration:**

1. **Administrative State:**
   - **Administratively Down:** The port is manually shut down by the network administrator and will not pass any traffic.
   - **Down:** The port is operationally down, usually due to a physical layer issue, and is not able to pass traffic.

   **Command Example:**
   ```plaintext
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   shutdown
   ```

2. **Duplex Mode:**
   - **Full Duplex:** The port can send and receive data simultaneously.
   - **Half Duplex:** The port can either send or receive data at any one time, but not both simultaneously.

   **Command Example:**
   ```plaintext
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   duplex full
   ```

3. **Speed Settings:**
   - **10 Mbps / 100 Mbps:** The port speed is set to a fixed rate of 10 or 100 megabits per second.
   - **Auto:** The port speed is automatically negotiated with the connected device.

   **Command Example:**
   ```plaintext
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
   speed 100
   ```

### CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection)

**Definition:**  
CSMA/CD is a network protocol for managing data collisions in Ethernet networks. It listens for a carrier signal before transmitting data and detects collisions during transmission. When a collision is detected, it stops the transmission and attempts to resend the data after a random time interval.

**Use Cases:**
- **Collision Management:** Ensuring efficient and error-free data transmission in a shared Ethernet network.
- **Legacy Ethernet Networks:** Utilized in older Ethernet networks operating in half-duplex mode.

**Example:**
In an Ethernet network, when two devices attempt to send data simultaneously, CSMA/CD will detect the collision, stop both transmissions, and schedule retransmissions to avoid future collisions.
